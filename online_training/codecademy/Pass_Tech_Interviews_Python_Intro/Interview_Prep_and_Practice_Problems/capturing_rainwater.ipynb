    "\n",
    "Imagine a very heavy rainstorm over a highway that has many potholes and cracks. The rainwater will collect in the empty spaces in the road, creating puddles. Each puddle can only be as high as the road around it, as any excess water will just flow away.\n",
    "\n",
    "The capturing rainwater problem asks you to calculate how much rainwater would be trapped in the empty spaces in a histogram (a chart which consists of a series of bars).\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be represented in Python as an array filled with the values [4, 2, 1, 3, 0, 1, 2]. Imagine that rainwater has fallen over the histogram and collected between the bars. \n",
    "\n",
    "Like with the road, the amount of water that can be captured at any given space cannot be higher than the bounds around it. To solve the problem, we need to write a function that will take in an array of integers and calculate the total water captured. Our function would return 6 for the histogram above. There are multiple ways to solve this problem, but we are going to focus on a naive implementation and an optimized implementation."

    "The foundation to all the solutions for this problem is that the amount of rainwater at any given index is the difference between the lower of highest bars to its left and right and the height of the index itself:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "water_at_index = min(highest_left_bound, highest_right_bound) - height_of_index\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Look at the histogram again. The amount of water at index 4 is 2. This is because its highest left bound is 4 (element at index 0), and its highest right bound is 2 (element at index 6). The lower of these two values is 2, and when we subtract the index’s height of 0, we get our answer of 2.\n"

When you see a problem that requires you to iterate through an array (or string), take a moment and think if it would be possible to iterate through the array in sections at the same time instead of in separate loops. Common problems that can be solved using the two-pointer technique are the **two sum problem (finding two numbers in an array that sum to a specified number)** and **reversing the characters in a string**."
