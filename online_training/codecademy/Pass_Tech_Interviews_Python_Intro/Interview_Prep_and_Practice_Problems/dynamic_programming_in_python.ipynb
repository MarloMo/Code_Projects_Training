    "## **Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic programming and memoization are great techniques to break up complex recursive problems into smaller chunks. They are especially useful when tackling problems that involve combinations. For example, if I were to ask you to calculate the total number of ways to get four dice rolls to sum to 13, you could imagine breaking that problem into multiple parts. You could split 13 into 6 and 7 and then find all the combinations of two rolls that would match each one of these. As you go down each path, you would probably start seeing a lot of similar calculations, and memoization would help you reduce the number of overall function calls by storing intermediate values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some other common problems that can be solved using dynamic programming are the knapsack problem, the coin change problem, and the partition problem.\n"
