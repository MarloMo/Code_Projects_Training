    "## **Trees Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "Trees are an essential data structure for storing hierarchical data with a directed flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to linked lists and graphs, trees are composed of nodes which hold data. The diagram represents nodes as rectangles and data as text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nodes also store references to zero or more other tree nodes. Data moves down from node to node. We depict those references as lines drawn between rectangles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Trees are often displayed with a single node at the top and connected nodes branching downwards.\n",
    "\n",
    "A company’s organization chart or a computer’s file directory are both real-world examples that can be represented as trees."

    "Trees grow downwards in computer science, and a root node is at the very top. The root of this tree is /photos.\n",
    "\n",
    "/photos references to two other nodes: /safari and /wedding. /safari and /wedding are children or child nodes of /photos.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conversely, /photos is a parent node because it has child nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "/safari and /wedding share the same parent node, which makes them siblings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the /safari node is child (to /photos) and parent (to lion.jpg and giraffe.jpg). It’s extremely common to have nodes act as both parent and child to different nodes within a tree.\n",
    "\n",
