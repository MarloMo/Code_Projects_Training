    "Recursion is a strategy for solving problems by defining the problem in terms of itself. For example, to sum the elements of a list we would take the first element and add it to the sum of the remaining elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "In programming, recursion means a function definition will include an invocation of the function within its own body. Here’s a pseudo-code example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "define function, speller\n",
    "    if there are no more letters\n",
    "        print \"all done\"\n",
    "    print the first letter\n",

    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If we invoked this function with “Zoe” as the argument, we would see “Z”, “o”, and “e” printed out before “all done”.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "1. function called with “Zoe”\n",

    "    print \"all done\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This section is the base case. We are **NOT** invoking the function under this condition. The equivalent base case from the previous exercise was when we had reached the front of the line.\n",

    "print the first letter\n",
    "```\n",
