    "The runtime of the `build_bst()` function can be analyzed by considering how the input list is divided and how many recursive calls are made.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the function:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Base Case:** If the input list `my_list` is empty, it returns \"No Child\". This is $O(1)$ time.\n",
    "2. **Finding the Middle Element:** Finding the middle index and accessing the middle element are both $O(1)$ operations.\n",
    "3. **Recursive Calls:** The function makes two recursive calls:\n",
    "   - One on the left half of the list: `my_list[:middle_idx]`\n",
    "   - One on the right half of the list: `my_list[middle_idx + 1:]`\n",
    "\n",
    "Splitting the list and copying it using slicing operations `my_list[:middle_idx]` and `my_list[middle_idx + 1:]` both take $O(n)$ time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's consider the recursion:\n",
    "\n",
    "- At each level of recursion, the list is split into two approximately equal halves.\n",
    "- This results in a binary tree structure where each level of recursion represents a level in the binary tree.\n",
    "- The depth of this recursion tree is $O(\\log n)$, where $n$ is the length of the original list.\n",
    "\n",
    "At each level of recursion, the total cost of splitting and creating new lists (slicing) is $O(n)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the total time complexity $T(n)$ can be expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "T(n) = 2T\\left(\\frac{n}{2}\\right) + O(n) \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a recurrence relation similar to the Merge Sort algorithm. Solving this recurrence relation using the Master Theorem:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "T(n) = O(n \\log n)\n",
    "$$\n",
