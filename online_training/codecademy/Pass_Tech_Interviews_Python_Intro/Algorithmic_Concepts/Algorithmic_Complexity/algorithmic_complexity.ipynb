    "## **Asymptotic Notation**\n",
    "\n",
    "Asymptotic Notation is used to describe the running time of an algorithm - how much time an algorithm takes with a given input, n. There are three different notations: big O, big Theta (Θ), and big Omega (Ω). big-Θ is used when the running time is the same for all cases, big-O for the worst case running time, and big-Ω for the best case running time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In computer science, we define how efficient a program is by its runtime. We can’t just time the program, however, because different computers run at different speeds. My dusty old PC does not run as fast as your brand new laptop. Programming is also done in many different languages, how do we account for that in the runtime? We need a general way to define a program’s runtime across these variable factors. We do this with Asymptotic Notation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, you can time a computer program, but different computers run at different speeds. For example, a program that takes 12 nanoseconds on one computer could take 45 milliseconds on another. Therefore, we need a more general way to gauge a program’s runtime. We do this with Asymptotic Notation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of timing a program, through asymptotic notation, we can calculate a program’s runtime by looking at how many instructions the computer has to perform based on the size of the program’s input: N.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may see the term execution count used in evaluating algorithms. Execution count is more precise than Big O notation. The following method, addUpTo(), depending on how we count the number of operations, can be as low as 2N or as high as 5N + 2\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "public class Main() { \n",
    "  void int addUpTo(int n) {\n",
    "    int total = 0;\n",
    "    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\n",
    "      total += i;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "  return total;\n",
    "  } \n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Determining execution count can increase in difficulty as our algorithms become even more sophisticated!\n",
    "\n",
    "But regardless of the execution count, the number of operations grows roughly proportionally with n. If n doubles, the number of operations will also roughly double.\n",
    "\n",
    "Big O Notation is a way to formalize fuzzy counting. It allows us to talk formally about how the runtime of an algorithm grows as the inputs grow. As we will see, Big O doesn’t focus on the details, only the trends"

If the input was a list of size N, the loop could iterate anywhere from 1 to N times depending on where 12 is in the list (or if it’s in the list at all). Thus, in the best case, it has a constant runtime and in the worst case it has a linear runtime.\n",
