    "* Classes are user-defined types.\n",
    "* Objects are instances of classes.\n",
    "* Class members are the data attributes and functions inside of a class.\n",
    "* Creating a new object from a class is called instantiation.\n",
    "* Class members can be designated as either private or public — they are private by default.\n",
    "* You can create a constructor to instantiate objects in a particular way.\n",
    "* A destructor allows you to execute any cleanup necessary before an object gets destroyed."

    "# There are four major benefits to object-oriented programming:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Encapsulation**: in OOP, you bundle code into a single unit where you can determine the scope of each piece of data.\n",
    "2. **Abstraction**: by using classes, you are able to generalize your object types, simplifying your program.\n",
    "3. **Inheritance**: because a class can inherit attributes and behaviors from another class, you are able to reuse more code.\n",
    "4. **Polymorphism**: one class can be used to create many objects, all from the same flexible piece of code."
