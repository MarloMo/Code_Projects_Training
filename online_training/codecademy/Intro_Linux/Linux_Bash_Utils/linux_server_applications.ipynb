    "A client Operating System (OS) runs on a client device such as a desktop or laptop computer, a mobile phone, or a smart electronic device. The client OS is designed to receive services from servers and provide an easy-to-approach interface for users.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, a server OS runs on computers to provide services to clients and users, often at the same time. A server OS is often more advanced in terms of its capabilities and applies high-security standards. Server operating systems are expected to be more resilient, stable, and efficient."
