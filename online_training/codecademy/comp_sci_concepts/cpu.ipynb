    "The performance or speed of a processor depends on, among many other factors, the clock rate (usually measured in hertz) and the instructions per clock (IPC), which together are the factors that make up the instructions per second (IPS) which measures CPU performance. CPU’s can have multiple cores which allow them to perform operations in parallel to one another which greatly increases the speed and efficiency of the computer."
