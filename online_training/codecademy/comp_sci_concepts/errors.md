## C++

* Compile-times errors: 

```
Errors found in the compiler
```

* Link-time errors: 

```
Errors found by the linker when it is trying to combine object files into an executable program.
```

* Run-time erros:

```
Errors found by checks in a running program.
```

* Logic erors:

```
Errors found by the programmer looking for causes of the erroneous results.


Once we have removed the compile-time errors, link-time errors, and run-time errors, the program runs successfully. But sometimes, the program doesn’t do what we want it to do or no output is produced. Hmmm…

These types of errors which provide incorrect output, but appears to be error-free, are called logical errors. These are one of the most common errors that happen to beginners and also usually the most difficult to find and eliminate.

Logical errors solely depend on the logical thinking of the programmer. Your job now is to figure out why the program didn’t do what you wanted it to do.

* Can learn test-driven development (TDD) technique to help find these kinds of errors!
